# Who am I?

When I was 16, I had an existential crisis and wanted to figure out who I was, I figurerd it out after 4 years. Currently, I am dealing with the same question again but in a different context. A context where this time I am not dealing with what I want to do, but what I want to do in engineering. 

I am someone who wants to be the jack of all trades and master of none. I joined Engineering Science first, I liked the idea of learning a broad range of knowledge related to different engineering fields. However, in Engineering Science you need to go into a very niche major in 3rd year, therefore, I transferred to mechanical engineering due to being the most broad major.

I am an analytical person. There might be different versions of defintitions to this personality trait. My version is someone who thinks rigorously before decision making, research and facts are the main decision factors; someone who loves to set high standards and work toward it systematically. 

I take huge risks. I came to Canada fro Iraq when I was 19 years old, alone. I started working and getting to know the Canadian culture, I joined a technology class sponsered by the City of Toronto and then applied to many jobs until Staples Canada offered me one. I did not study for 2 years. I am incredibly proud of how far I have come. I did not believe I had any chance of one day I would be studying in the world's highest ranking university and I am very fortunate and grateful. If I could do that alone, I think I can do a lot more.

I consider myself as a compassionate engineer. I like to be a part of innovative mission where radical changes are made. Finally, I am someone who does the work. I spend a lot of time to get something done and I do not like to lower my standards.


# My future career, ***As of now, susceptible to revision***

I want to start an engineering company, even if it fails. Engineering is a wonderful field where it gives you the potential to build great ventures. If anyone builds a company it should be an engineer. Currently, I do not have an idea for a company. Therefore, in the short term the plan might be different. 

In the short term, I would like to work for a company where it is driven by a big mission. Tesla Motors can be a great example of this. Tesla is driven by a mission of radically changing the automotive sector with electrifying cars, a mission like such gives me a passion to do my best. Furthermore, Tesla is a diverse company and that is what I enjoy the most. I would like to be a part of a company where all kinds of engineers learn and interac with each other.

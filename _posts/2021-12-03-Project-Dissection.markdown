The gearbox was a part of the Mechanical Engineering Design, *MIE243*, course assignment. The purpose of this assignment was to design a gearbox from scratch and use 3D printing to manufacture it. Throughout the fall semester of 2021, we learned to use SolidWorks to either replicate other designs or modify them; this assignment being the last was about the complete engineering process from design to manufacturing. The amount of lessons learned from this project is inconceivable for me. 

What did I learn?
- Fast prototyping over perfectionism
- The first prototype never works
- Healthy teamwork leads to great ideas
- I have a strong imagination 
- I love being rigorous during idea generation
- I enjoy CAD 

Firstly, we started considering various options to achieve a **colinear** gearbox with a **12:1** ratio. The options included parallel gear design with spur, helical or herringbone, and also planetary gears. As a group, we decided to go with spur gears due to the limitations we had with SolidWorks Toolbox capability and the time constraint of the assignment.

*The calculations I did relating to gear ratios, teeth and centre to centre distance to achieve the colinar design*

Then, I began to do various calculations to achieve the specifications we had set. The initial calculations were able to achieve the 12:1 ratio but not the colinear design. However, by doing some iterations and changing teeth number I was able to overcome it. 

Next, I designed the gears with solidworks. SolidWorks has a toolbox feature where gears can be created with specific parameters. When the other team members finished the housing and shaft we began to 3D print our first iteration.

### First Iteration:

The first iteration of the gearbox had huge issues. Including: 
1. The shaft tolerance was too much, this caused the gear to slide over the shaft.
2. The components were very small due to scaling the whole design by 60%. We had to do this due to the 6 hour printing constraint.
3. Assembly was non intuitive.
4. Design was not colinear due to wrong calculations I made.
5. The shafts were sliding and falling over since there was no restriction 

### Second Iteration:

The second iteration solved some issues, however these issues still persisted:
1. Too much tolerance and the gear was sliding over the shaft.
2. The labeling on the components was not able to print properly since they were to thin.

### Final Iteration:

This iteration solved *almost all* the issues. The tolerance was a persistent issue during the other iterations and including this one. Luckily, the shafts from the second iteration were a perfect match for the gears in the final iteration, with some sanding required. 

Labelling all the components was my **greatest idea**. I was able to print all of them during the final iteration. This really helped to make the instructions clearer which I will explain later. 

### IKEA Instructions:

*The IKEA instructions using SolidWorks Composer*

I handled the full responsibility of creating the assembly instructions. I created the instructions with SolidWorks Composer; a program I had no experience at before this and I was able to learn it in 2 hours. I am very glad how the results turned out for the instructions since it was excatly what the instructors where looking for.

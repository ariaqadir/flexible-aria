The gearbox was a part of the Mechanical Engineering Design, *MIE243*, course assignment. The purpose of this assignment was to design a gearbox from scratch and use 3D printing to manufacture it. Throughout the fall semester of 2021, we learned to use SolidWorks to either replicate other designs or modify them; this assignment being the last was about the complete engineering process from design to manufacturing. The amount of lessons learned from this project is inconceivable for me. 

What did I learn?
- Fast prototyping over perfectionism
- The first prototype never works
- Healthy teamwork leads to great ideas
- I have a strong imagination 
- I love being rigorous during idea generation
- I enjoy CAD 

Firstly, we started considering various options to achieve a **colinear** gearbox with a **12:1** ratio. The options included parallel gear design with spur, helical or herringbone, and also planetary gears. As a group, we decided to go with spur gears due to the limitations we had with SolidWorks Toolbox capability and the time constraint of the assignment.

Then, I began to do various calculations to achieve the specifications we had set. The initial calculations were able to achieve the 12:1 ratio but not the colinear design. However, by doing some iterations and changing teeth number I was able to overcome it. 

Next, I designed the gears with solidworks. SolidWorks has a toolbox feature where gears can be created with specific parameters. When the other team members finished the housing and shaft we began to 3D print our first iteration.

**First Iteration:**

The first iteration of the gearbox had huge issues. Including: 
- The shaft tolerance was too much, this caused the gear to slide over the shaft.
- The components were very small due to scaling the whole design by 60%. We had to do this due to the 6 hour printing constraint.
- Assembly was non intuitive

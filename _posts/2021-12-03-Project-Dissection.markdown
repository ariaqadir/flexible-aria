The gearbox was a part of the Mechanical Engineering Design, *MIE243*, course assignment. The purpose of this assignment was to design a gearbox from scratch and use 3D printing to manufacture it. Through out the fall semester of 2021, we learned to use SolidWorks to either replicate other designs or modify them; this assignment being the last was about the complete engineering process from design to manufacturing. The amount of lessons learned from this project is inconceivable for me. 

What did I learn?
-Fast prototyping over perfectionism
-First prototype never works
-Healthy teamwork leads to great ideas
-I have a strong imagination 
-I love being rigorous during idea generation
-I enjoy CAD 

Firstly, we started considering a number of options to achive a **colinear** gearbox. The options included parallel gear design with spur, helical or hearingbone and also planetary gears. As a group, we decided to go with spur gears due to the limitations we had with SolidWorks Toolbox capability and the time constraint of the assignment.

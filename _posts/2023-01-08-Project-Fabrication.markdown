### Problem

Fabricated the complete solar car, including composite chassis from tooling to layup, battery enclosures, solar panel installation, and thermoformed plastic canopy.

### Process

- Designed the tooling stack-up with optimization software for minimal material waste, to be CNC-machined into the final plug shape.
- Manufactured the mold by applying an initial gelcoat layer followed by fiberglass layup over the plug surface, with extensive post-processing to achieve a smooth finish.
- Produced the final chassis components using both vacuum infusion and hand layup methods, depending on the part requirements.
- Assembled all components using reference features to maintain tight tolerances throughout the build.

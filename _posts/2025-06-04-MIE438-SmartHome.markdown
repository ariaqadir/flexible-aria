### What?

Designing and building a smart home thermostat using an ESP32 microcontroller, capable of controlling a fan and heater based on thermistor sensor readings, with the ability to override settings via voice commands or wireless control through a web interface

### How?

#### Hardware

- The project consisted of several components connected to an ESP32 microcontroller.
- Voltage regulators were used to step down the voltage for 5V components and a buck convertor for higher current components such as the heater. 
- The board was powered externally with a 12V power supply through a barrel jack connector. 
- The microcontroller controlled a 2-channel relay to turn on/off the fan and heater based on temperature limits set by the user. 
- Both I2S and I2C communication protocols were used based.

Soldered all the components on a prototying board with 22 gauge wires and male/female headers for components to be removable.

#### Software

- Arduino code was used to write the software for the ESP32 microcontroller. 
- Hysteresis was implemented in the thermistor control logic to prevent rapid toggling of the fan and heater near the temperature threshold.
- An HTML website was created with buttons to control the fan and heater manually or automatically through wireless communication.

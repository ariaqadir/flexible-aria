### What?

Designing and building a smart home thermostat using an ESP32 microcontroller, capable of controlling a fan and heater based on thermistor sensor readings, with the ability to override settings via voice commands or wireless control through a web interface

### How?

#### Hardware

- The system was built around an **ESP32 microcontroller**, which interfaced with all peripheral components.
- **Power Management**:
  - A **12V external power supply** was connected via a barrel jack.
  - **Voltage regulators** stepped down voltage for 5V components.
  - A **buck converter** was used to supply higher current to power-demanding components such as the heater.
- **Relay Control**:
  - A **2-channel relay module** was used to switch the fan and heater ON/OFF based on user-defined temperature limits.
- **Communication Protocols**:
  - **I2C**: Used for interfacing with the temperature sensor.
  - **I2S**: Used for driving the speaker amplifier.
  - **SPI**: Connected to the microSD card reader.
  - **Serial**: Used to control relays.
  - **PWM**: Implemented for controlling fan speed (RPM).

- All components were **soldered onto a prototyping board** using 22-gauge wires.
- **Male and female headers** were used to ensure components were modular and easily replaceable.

#### Software

- The ESP32 was programmed using Arduino IDE and C++, with custom firmware handling sensor input, relay control, and communication protocols.
- Temperature control logic included hysteresis to avoid rapid toggling of the fan and heater around threshold values, improving system stability and extending component lifespan.
- A responsive HTML web interface was hosted on the ESP32, allowing users to wirelessly monitor temperature and switch between manual and automatic control modes for both the fan and heater.

### Mistakes?

A key oversight was the omission of a protection diode between the linear voltage regulator and the ESP32. As a result, when the ESP32 was powered via USB from a laptop while the external 12V power supply was disconnected, reverse current flowed from the microcontroller back into the regulator. This led to damage and eventual failure of the ESP32. Adding a diode would have blocked reverse current and protected the microcontroller in this scenario.

### Results?

Key lessons included integrating hardware components and effectively managing power. implemented wireless overrides through a web interface and writing code for different communication protocols. 

- **Power Management:** Using linear regulators and buck convertors to manipulate voltages.
- **Wireless Communication:** Built an HTML web interface to wirelessly control the Smart Home settings. 
- **Code for Communication Protocols:** writing code for hardware components with different communication protocols.

Blue Sky Solar Racing is all I love about engineering combined into a single club. Blue Sky Solar is about designing a fast, efficient car using solar and battery alone cable of driving in australia's outback, from Darwin to Adelaide. This club is so diverse where brilliant students from all the engineering majors come and join ranging from software, electrical, mechanical, and students studying maths and physics. 

### Diversity in engineering:

This club reflects what I want to do in the future. I love a place where diversity is a major core of the environment. Currently, I am a member of fabrication where we are responsible for manufacturing the car from scratch. However, it's very easy for me to transition to the other parts of the team such as moving to array, mechanical, or the electrical subteam.

### How I began:

I started with sanding. When I joined Blue Sky, my first day a disaster happened. The high-density foam layers were separated from each other. We began doing *Bondo* and sanding for an entire month almost every day. The first thing I learned was fabrication is far from perfect. What you design in CAD is easy, the manufacturing is miles harder. 

After the sanding, we transported the plug to Simcoe, Ontario where we make the mold. However, to make a mold a chain of events needs to happen. First, we used primer, then made a structure where the mold can stand on it, we need to put release so the mold can detach from the plug later on. 

Finally, we do a lot of testing before doing the actual job on the car. We are testing with carbon-fiber composites on a small 3D-printed version of the car.

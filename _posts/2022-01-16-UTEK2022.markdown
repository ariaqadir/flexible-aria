UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO ENGINEERING KOMPETITIONS (UTEK) is an engineering competition which takes place yearly. I was part of a 4 member team participating in this event. The theme of this year was "Earth" and the challenge was about designing a car able to collect the most amount of trash in 1.5 minutes. Creativity and uniqueness were also considered. 

The final design was modifying the car with the parts given to all the teams, and our team's car consisted of three major tools.

1. The main tool was a rotating "brush" sweeping the waste under the car. 
2. A shovel was added to the other end of the car to move trash around obstacles. 
3. A magnet that was able to pick up a coin at a certain height.
